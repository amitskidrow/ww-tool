### ‚ùå EXPECTED FAILURES (1/11)

#### 11. **Non-existent File Handling** - ‚ùå EXPECTED FAILURE
- **Test:** Try to monitor non-existent file
- **Result:** Clear error message with proper exit code
- **Assessment:** **CORRECT BEHAVIOR** - should fail fast with clear error

- **Filter System:** Properly ignores irrelevant files (.git, __pycache__, etc.)

### **Service Management**
- **Service Naming:** Consistent pattern (`ww-<filename>.service`)
- **State Tracking:** Accurate status reporting
- **Log Management:** Integrated with systemd journaling
- **Cleanup:** Proper service stopping and cleanup

### **Error Handling**
- **Syntax Errors:** Graceful handling, clear error messages
- **File Permissions:** Appropriate "flapping" state
- **Missing Files:** Fast failure with clear error
- **Resource Limits:** No apparent memory leaks or resource exhaustion
